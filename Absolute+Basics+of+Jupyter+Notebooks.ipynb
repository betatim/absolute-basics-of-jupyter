This was the first published astronomy paper that used observations using a telescope, which implicitly (but not explicitly) proved the Copernican system of a sun, not the Earth, which other celestial bodies revolved around.\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "> \"I therefore concluded and decided unhesitatingly, that there are three stars in the heavens moving about Jupiter, as Venus and Mercury round the Sun; which at length was established as clear as daylight by numerous subsequent observations. These observations also established that there are not only three, but four, erratic sidereal bodies performing their revolutions round Jupiter...the revolutions are so swift that an observer may generally get differences of position every hour.\"\n",
